#  Heal Bharat  
## AI Emergency Pressure & Ambulance Load Prediction System

---

##  Project Overview

Heal Bharat is an AI-driven Emergency Monitoring Dashboard designed to help hospitals and emergency authorities predict and manage Emergency Department (ED) overload situations.

The system analyzes emergency indicators such as ambulance arrivals, accident-prone zones, and emergency pressure levels to provide early alerts and improve emergency preparedness.

This project represents **Phase-1 (Foundation & MVP)** of the AI Emergency Pressure & Ambulance Load Prediction System.

---

##  Objective

The main objective of the system is to:

- Predict emergency pressure on hospitals
- Identify accident-prone hotspot zones
- Forecast ambulance arrival trends
- Trigger early alerts for overload situations
- Improve ambulance and hospital resource allocation
- Reduce emergency chaos and response delays

---

##  Phase-1 Scope (Foundation)

This phase focuses on building the **core foundation** of the system.

### Implemented Features

Real-time Emergency Monitoring Dashboard  
Emergency Pressure Index (EPI) Calculation  
Ambulance Load Density Indicator  
Rule-based Early Alert System (Normal / Warning / Critical)  
Accident Hotspot Zone Detection  
Ambulance Arrival Forecast Visualization  
City, Hospital, and Date Filters (MVP Logic)  
Fully Responsive Frontend UI  

---

##  Core Logic Implemented

### 1. Emergency Pressure Index (EPI)

EPI = Base Emergency Pressure + (Ambulance Arrivals × Weight)

This helps simulate emergency department overload conditions.

---

### 2. Ambulance Load Density

Represents incoming ambulance load relative to hospital capacity.

---

### 3. Hotspot Scoring
Hotspot Score = Accident Count × Risk Weight
